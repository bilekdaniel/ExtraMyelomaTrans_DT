Script is functional. Might need few adjustment with relative adresses (WIP).
Ideas for improvement -     1. Add script for removing special characters from sample names, which conflicts with graphs.
                            2. Add script that assigns HUGO symbol to corresponding ENSEMBL code in outputs; remove "" and trim to first 15 characters.
