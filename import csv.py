"""             read_ids_from_file
    Reads a specific column (ID column) from a CSV file and returns the IDs as a list.

    Parameters:
        file_path (str): Path to the CSV file to read from.

    Returns:
        A list containing the IDs from the specified column.

    Behavior:
        The function reads the contents of the CSV file specified by file_path.
        It assumes that the first row of the file contains headers and skips it.
        The function extracts the values from the specified ID column (ID_COLUMN_INDEX)
        and returns them as a list.
"""


"""                 write_common_rows
    Writes rows from the source_file to the commons_from_csv file,
    filtering out rows whose first element (ID) is not present in the common_ids set.

    Parameters:
        source_file (str): Path to the source CSV file to read from.
        commons_from_csv1 (str): Path to the target CSV file to write the filtered rows.
        common_ids (set): A set containing the common IDs shared between two CSV files.

    Behavior:
        The function reads rows from the source_file and writes the rows to the commons_from_csv file
        if their first element (ID) is present in the common_ids set.
"""


"""               read_dict_from_file
    Reads two specific columns from a CSV file and returns the data as a list of dictionaries.

    Parameters:
        file_path (str): Path to the CSV file to read from; usually file from write_common_rows.

    Returns:
        list: A list containing dictionaries with data from specified columns.

    Behavior:
        The function reads the contents of the CSV file specified by file_path.
        The function creates a dictionary for each row, where the key is extracted from the
        specified ID column (ID_COLUMN_INDEX) and the value from the specified VALUE column (VALUE_COLUMN_INDEX).
        The dictionaries are collected in a list and returned.

"""


"""                  write_rows_matching_condition         

    Writes rows from the source_file to the commons_from_csv1 file,
    based on specific conditions and comparisons with dictionaries
    from the two common ID files.

    Parameters:
        source_file (str): Path to the source CSV file to read from.
        DE_same_direction_from_csv (str): Path to the target CSV file to write the filtered rows.

    Behavior:
        The function reads rows from the source_file and compares values with dictionaries
        in file1_ids and file2_ids. It writes the rows to the commons_from_csv1 file if the
        following conditions are met:
        1. The numeric values in both dictionaries have the same sign (positive or negative).
        2. The ID in the row matches the key in the dictionary.
